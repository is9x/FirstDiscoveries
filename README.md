## Your first discovery
```💧 Water``` + ```💧 Water``` = ```🌊 Lake```  
```🌎 Earth``` + ```🌎 Earth``` = ```🏔️ Mountain```  
```🌎 Earth``` + ```💧 Water``` = ```🌱 Plant```  
```🌫️ Dust``` + ```🌱 Plant``` = ```🌱 Pollen```  
```🌎 Earth``` + ```🔥 Fire``` = ```🌋 Lava```  
```🌎 Earth``` + ```🌋 Lava``` = ```🪨 Stone```  
```🌱 Pollen``` + ```🪨 Stone``` = ```🌾 Amber```  
```🌊 Lake``` + ```🏔️ Mountain``` = ```🏞️ Fjord```  
```🌎 Earth``` + ```💨 Wind``` = ```🌫️ Dust```  
```🌫️ Dust``` + ```💨 Steam``` = ```☁️ Cloud```  
```🔥 Fire``` + ```💧 Water``` = ```💨 Steam```  
```🔥 Fire``` + ```💨 Steam``` = ```🚗 Engine```  
```☁️ Cloud``` + ```🚗 Engine``` = ```✈️ Jet```  
```🏞️ Fjord``` + ```✈️ Jet``` = ```🥊 Fighter```  
```🌾 Amber``` + ```🥊 Fighter``` = ```🤖 Terminator```  

**Now that you have ```🤖 Terminator```, you can begin the process of making your first discovery.**  

```🔥 Fire``` + ```💧 Water``` = ```💨 Steam```  
```🌎 Earth``` + ```🌫️ Dust``` = ```🪐 Planet```  
```💨 Steam``` + ```🪐 Planet``` = ```🕯️ Steampunk```  
```🌫️ Dust``` + ```🕯️ Steampunk``` = ```🤖 Robot```  
```🌎 Earth``` + ```💨 Wind``` = ```🌫️ Dust```  
```💨 Wind``` + ```💨 Wind``` = ```🌪️ Tornado```  
```🌫️ Dust``` + ```🌪️ Tornado``` = ```🌪️ Dust Storm```  
```🌪️ Dust Storm``` + ```🕯️ Incense``` = ```🪨 Sandalwood```  
```🌎 Earth``` + ```🌎 Earth``` = ```🏔️ Mountain```  
```💨 Wind``` + ```🏔️ Mountain``` = ```🌨️ Avalanche```  
```🌎 Earth``` + ```💧 Water``` = ```🌱 Plant```  
```🔥 Fire``` + ```💨 Wind``` = ```💨 Smoke```  
```🌱 Plant``` + ```💨 Smoke``` = ```🕯️ Incense```  
```🌨️ Avalanche``` + ```🕯️ Incense``` = ```☃️ Snowman```  
```🪨 Sandalwood``` + ```☃️ Snowman``` = ```🎅 Santa Claus```  
```🤖 Robot``` + ```🎅 Santa Claus``` = ```🤖 Robo Santa```  

**That was the heavy work.**  
_Now, make a ```🎈 Hot Air Balloon```_  
```🔥 Fire``` + ```💧 Water``` = ```💨 Steam```  
```🌎 Earth``` + ```💧 Water``` = ```🌱 Plant```  
```💨 Wind``` + ```🌱 Plant``` = ```🌼 Dandelion```  
```💨 Steam``` + ```🌼 Dandelion``` = ```🎈 Hot Air Balloon```  

**Last step!**  
_Now that you have a ```🎈 Hot Air Balloon```, you can make ```🤖 Terminator 2```!_  
```🎈 Hot Air Balloon``` + ```🤖 Terminator``` = ```🤖 Terminator 2```  

**This part gets complicated!**  
```🤖 Terminator``` + ```🤖 Terminator 2``` = ```🤖 Terminator 3```  
```🤖 Terminator 3``` + ```🤖 Terminator 4``` = ```🤖 Terminator 5```  
```🤖 Terminator 5``` + ```🤖 Terminator 4``` = ```🤖 Terminator 6```  
```🤖 Terminator 6``` + ```🤖 Terminator 5``` = ```🤖 Terminator 7```  
```🤖 Terminator 7``` + ```🤖 Terminator 2``` = ```🤖 Terminator 9```  
```🤖 Terminator 9``` + ```🤖 Terminator 6``` = ```🤖 Terminator 15```  
```🤖 Terminator 9``` + ```🤖 Terminator 15``` = ```🤖 Terminator 24```  
```🤖 Terminator 24``` + ```🤖 Terminator 15``` = ```🤖 Terminator 39```  

Now, drag ```🤖 Robo Santa``` over to ```🤖 Terminator 39```
